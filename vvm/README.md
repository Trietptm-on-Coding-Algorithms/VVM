Veits Virtual Machine
---------------------

A virtual machine that executes assembler-like code.


Instruction set
---------------

Up until now, all the operations are executed on integers(hence the
I\* prefix).

*Operations overview*:

IADD - Adds the two items to each other that are on top of the stack
and stores the result on top of the stack.
ISUB - Subtracts the two items from each other that are on top of the
stack and stores the result on top of the stack.
IMULT - Multiplies the two items to each other that are on top of the
stack and stores the result on top of the stack.
IDIV - Performs a division operation to the two items that are on top 
of the stack and stores the result on top of the stack.
IMOD - Performs a modulo operation to the two items that are on top 
of the stack and stores the result on top of the stack.
ILT - Checks whether the item on top of the stack is greater than the
item below it and stores a boolean on top of the stack.
IEQ - Checks whether the item on top of the stack is equal to the
item below it and stores a boolean on top of the stack.
IGT - Checks whether the item on top of the stack is smaller than the
item below it and stores a boolean on top of the stack.
ILEQ - Checks whether the item on top of the stack is smaller than or 
equal to the item below it and stores a boolean on top of the stack.
IGEQ - Checks whether the item on top of the stack is greater than or 
equal to the item below it and stores a boolean on top of the stack.
BR - Jumps to the instruction that is provided as an argument.
BRT - Jumps to the instruction that is provided as an argument if the
value on top of the stack is TRUE.
BRF - Jumps to the instruction that is provided as an argument if the
value on top of the stack is FALSE.
ICONST - Puts the argument provided to the operation on top of the 
stack.
LOAD - Loads an element from any position on the stack on top of the
stack(usually used to get function arguments like this: LOAD -3).
GLOAD - Loads an element from any position on the data segment  on 
top of the stack.
STORE - Stores an element on the stack.
GSTORE - Stores an element in the data segment.
PRINT - Prints the element on top of the stack as character.
IPRINT - Prints the element on top of the stack as integer.
POP - Pops the element on top of the stack.
HALT - Ends the program.
CALL - calls a subroutine with a number of arguments.
RET - Returns from a subroutine with a return value.
FETCH - Fetches a value.
IINC -Increments the value on top of the stack by one(equal to ++).
IDEC -Decrements the value on top of the stack by one(equal to --).
